## Why v2
The ThedasMC Stock Market plugin v2 is currently in the early stages of development. However the download is free for everyone and is free to register. The goal of the plugin is to be similar to v1. However, there are a couple major differences:
1. Saved data is saved in a global database managed by ThedasMC. So any corruption or funky data can be fixed in theory by contacting me on Discord. No management of the data is required by the server.
2. The plugin will retrieve data from a backend hosted on ThedasMC.com which connects to IEXCloud. This allows less requests to be made by being able to cache. In v1 each Minecraft server running the plugin would cache data, now the cache will be global for all servers.
3. Cool features can be added that utilizes all server data.
